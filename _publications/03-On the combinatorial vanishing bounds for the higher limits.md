In this paper, we introduce a model category structure in the category of functors from a filtered poset to cochain complexes in which higher limits of functors that take values in R-modules can be computed by means of a fibrant replacement. We explicitly describe a procedure to compute the fibrant replacement and, finally, deduce some vanishing bounds for the higher limits.
