In this paper, we present a model category structure for the category of functors from a filtered EI-category $\CC$ to cochain complexes of $R$-modules. In that model category structure, the higher limits of functors $\CC\to \Mod_R$ are described by means of fibrant objects. We show how, under certain conditions, the shape of the isomorphism poset of $\CC$ induces a vanishing bound for the higher limits of any functor that improves the well-known bound induced by the length of the chains. As an application, we give a new proof of the existence of complex homotopy representations of the lie group $G_2$.
