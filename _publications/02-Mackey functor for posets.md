We define Mackey functors over posets mimicking the classical notion and introduce a weak version of them. Then we show that they are acyclic by analyzing cofibrant and pseudo-projective objects in the category of functors indexed in a filtered poset. As application, we study homotopy colimits over posets and we give a homology decomposition for the classifying space of the Bianchi group Gamma 1.
