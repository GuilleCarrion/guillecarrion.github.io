Higher limits are derived functors of the limit construction. Classically they are computed using tools from homological algebra. In algebraic topology, the cohomology of a colimit of spaces can be computed from the higher limits of the functor obtained from the cohomology of the spaces involved. In particular, if the higher limits vanish, then the cohomology of the colimit is just the limit of the cohomologies.   In this talk we will show how we can use the techniques from model categories, inspired in homotopy theory, to describe higher limits. When the indexing category is a poset, we will describe explicit bounds for the vanishing of higher limits in terms of properties of the functor.
