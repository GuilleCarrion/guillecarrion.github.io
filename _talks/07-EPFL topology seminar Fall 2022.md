Classically, higher limits of functors $\operatorname{Fun}(\mathcal C,R\operatorname{-Mod})$ have been computed using the definition of the (right) derived functor of limit in homogical algebra. In this talk, we introduce a new approach to these computations. We consider a functor $F\colon \mathcal C\to R\operatorname{-Mod}$ as a functor taking values in cochain complexes of $R-$modules, $\operatorname{Ch}(R)$, where a module is just a complex concentrated in degree $0$. The category of functors $\operatorname{Fun(\mathcal{C},\operatorname{Ch}(R))$, $\mathcal{C}$ being a filtered poset and $R$ a commutative ring, admits a model category structure in which higher limits of a functor $F\colon \mathcal{C}\to R\operatorname{-Mod}$ are described as $\lim^iF=H^i(\lim \mathbf{R} F)$ where $\mathbf{R} F$ is a fibrant replacement of $F$. Using the Reedy structure on $\mathcal C$, we give a description of how to calculate a fibrant replacement and we obtain bounds for the vanishing of these higher limits.
