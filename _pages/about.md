About me
====

I am currently working as Postdoc at Departamento de Álgebra, Geometría y Topología of Universidad de Málaga. I obtained my PhD Degree from Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona under the supervision of Natàlia Castellana Vila and Antonio Díaz Ramos. 

My research interest are:
- Higher limits, 
- Homotopical and Homological algebra,
- Combinatorial properties of posets, and
- Classifying spaces
