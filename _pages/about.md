About me
===

 I am currently working as assistant professor at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (Department of applied mathematics). I obtained my PhD Degree from Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona under the supervision of Natàlia Castellana Vila and Antonio Díaz Ramos. After my Ph.D. I was working as postdoc at Departamento de Álgebra, Geometría y Topología of Universidad de Málaga.

My research interest are:
- Higher limits, 
- Homotopical and Homological algebra,
- Combinatorial properties of posets, 
- Bousfield localisation, and
- related topics in Algebraic topology and Category theory
